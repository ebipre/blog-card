## My process
-I started with HTML file, writing the bulk of the text and the images needed to replicate the design
-Next i creat a css file where i wrote the styling for the different classes i used for divs and spans and all the images too
-Then i began editing my codes to get the design to be as close as a replica as i could
-I also asked AI for was to make my page responsive and how to make the whole page look at lot like the preview
-Then i wrote the READ.ME file and proceeded to upload my project
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned
During the process of making this blog card, i learned use to make my work responsive using the css '@media' function. 
I learnt this earlier but i forgot how to use it, not until during this project, i had to implement it, so I had to relearn it.

Also I got to kmow how to use 'rem' to denote my sizes instead of 'px' that i was traditionally accustomed to.
I got to know the difference between them, thereby knowing the situation inwhich to use them

And finally, during this process, I also got to know the major difference between 'div' and 'span', and how to use each of them to make my code more effective.


### Continued development
After finishing up this project, I realised I needed to built more responsive projects to beter understand how to go about that. That is one of the areas where I'll be focusing on in future projects
